# Flatpak Firehose

A feed reader for recently updated Flathub applications with changelogs from source repositories.

## Architecture

**Hybrid Approach:** Go backend (data pipeline) + Astro frontend (UI rendering)

### What Go Does
- Fetches recently updated apps from Flathub API
- Fetches detailed app metadata including appstream releases
- Identifies source GitHub repositories for each app
- Fetches actual release notes from GitHub repositories
- Outputs JSON data for Astro to consume

### What Astro Does
- Imports JSON data (generated by Go)
- Renders static HTML with app cards
- Displays changelogs from both Flathub metadata and GitHub releases
- Deploys to GitHub Pages

## Building

```bash
# Install Go dependencies
go mod download

# Install Node dependencies
npm install

# Build (runs Go pipeline, then Astro build)
npm run build

# Development server
npm run dev
```

## Data Flow

1. **Fetch Flathub Apps** → Get recently updated apps from Flathub API
2. **Enrich with Details** → Fetch app metadata, extract source repo URLs
3. **Fetch GitHub Releases** → Get actual changelogs from source repositories
4. **Output JSON** → Write to `src/data/apps.json`
5. **Astro Build** → Generate static site from JSON data

## Features

- ✅ Tracks recently updated Flathub applications
- ✅ Shows changelogs from actual source repositories (not @flathub repo)
- ✅ Maps apps to their GitHub repositories
- ✅ Fetches GitHub release notes for real changelogs
- ✅ Falls back to Flathub appstream releases
- ✅ Dark theme UI inspired by GitHub
- ✅ Responsive grid layout
